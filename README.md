# 🛒 DMart E-Commerce EDA Project

Welcome to my exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on **DMart**, a leading retail brand. This project demonstrates my data science and analytics skills through comprehensive analysis and insightful visualizations of e-commerce sales data.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I performed an in-depth EDA to uncover hidden patterns and derive meaningful business insights from raw transactional data. Here's a breakdown of what’s included:

### ✅ Key Features

- 📊 **Descriptive Statistics**  
  Implemented using my custom-built Python library called **`Stats`**, which showcases foundational statistical computations from scratch.

- 🧮 **Data Manipulation**  
  Utilized **Pandas** and **NumPy** for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.

- 📈 **Data Visualization**  
  - Plotted informative charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
  - Included bar plots, line graphs, pie charts, and distribution plots

- 🔗 **Grouped Analysis & Correlation**
  - Performed grouped aggregations by categories such as product, location, and time
  - Created a **correlation heatmap** to explore relationships between numerical features

- 💡 **Insights & Observations**  
  Extracted meaningful insights and trends from the data using analytical thinking—such as customer behavior, top-performing products, seasonal trends, and sales drivers.

## 📁 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Custom `Stats` Library

## 📊 Output

The final result includes:
- Interactive and static visualizations
- Insight summaries
- Grouped metrics and correlation analysis

## 📌 Usage

This repository is useful for:
- Beginners learning EDA  
- Analysts exploring e-commerce datasets
